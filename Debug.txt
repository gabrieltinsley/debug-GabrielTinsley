Bug 1:
Ran SetTester.java from handout files
emptySet_testIsEmpty fails
Set breakpoint in SetTester at line 111 where emptySet_testIsEmpty is run
Stepped through ArraySet constructor - no problems there
Stepped into testIsEmpty and into ArraySet isEmpty()
Found return on line 40 has rear > 0 which would not be true for an Empty ArraySet
Created an if-else statement where if rear == 0 return true else return false
Rerun tester - emptySet_testIsEmpty now passes 

Bug 2:
Ran SetTester.java from handout files
emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty fails
Set breakpoint in SetTester at line 147 where emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty is run
Stepped through ArraySet constructor - no problems there
Stepped into line 137 of SetTester to get to add Element T method
Found setArray is containing the value of integer A but rear did not equal integer A
On line 64 I added rear++ to set the rear equal to the number of elements in the ArraySet
Rerun tester - emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty now passes

Bug 3:
Ran SetTester.java from handout files
testRemove fails with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
Set breakpoint in SetTester at line 265 because the Stack trace printed out told me the test A_addB_AB_testRemoveA is failing
